                                Breaking Bad is an American neo-Western crime
                                 drama television series created and produced by Vince
                                  Gilligan. The show aired on AMC from January 20, 2008,
                                   to September 29, 2013, consisting of five seasons for
                                    a total of 62 episodes. It was set and filmed in Albuquerque,
                                     New Mexico, and tells the story of Walter White (Bryan Cranston),
                                      an underpaid and dispirited high school chemistry teacher who is
                                       struggling with a recent diagnosis of stage-three lung cancer.
                                        White turns to a life of crime, partnering with his former student
                                         Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), by producing and distributing
                                          crystallized methamphetamine to secure his family's
                                           financial future before he dies, while navigating
                                            the dangers of the criminal underworld. The title
                                             is a Southern colloquialism meaning "to turn to
                                              a life of crime".[8] Gilligan characterized the
                                               series as showing Walter's transformation from
                                                a soft-spoken Mr. Chips into Scarface.
